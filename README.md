# Shamash

An in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL â€“ extended with a map, query selection, etc.

## About the name

Shamash was the ancient Mesopotamian sun god and the god of justice. As the sun illuminates the world, this tool aims to illuminate and bring clarity to GraphQL APIs, making them easier to explore and understand.

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Build the app

```sh
npm run build
```

## Run the app

### Run build against localhost

```sh
npm start
```

## Deploy to dev (for quick testing)

Deployment to dev is [done automatically](.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml) when a PR is merged (or push to master), but sometimes you need to test quickly:

```sh
firebase -P dev deploy --only hosting
```

The updated app should now be available at https://api.dev.entur.io/graphql-explorer
